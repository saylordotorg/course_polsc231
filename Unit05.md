**Unit 5: Making Policy in the American Political System** <span
id="5"></span> 
*After exploring the foundations, political behavior, and institutions
of the American political system, this final unit looks at public policy
in the United States, the place where all of these other components of
the American political system intersect. The unit will begin by
examining the general policy-making process and how each branch of
government impacts American public policy. Then, we will take a deeper
look into the three major realms of public policy – economic, social,
and foreign affairs policy. In each of these realms, we will discuss
theories of policy and then look closer at how policy has been
implemented over time. This unit is a fitting way to end the course by
demonstrating how everything that we’ve learned thus far comes together
to shape the various public policies that impact American society as a
whole.*

     Instructions: Watch these lectures to gain some general
    understanding of important terms and concepts for this subunit;
    these lectures will cover material you will need ot know for the
    first three subunits of this unit. In any society, governmental
    entities enact laws, make policies, and allocate resources. This is
    true at all levels. Public policy can be generally defined as a
    system of laws, regulatory measures, courses of action, and funding
    priorities concerning a given topic promulgated by a governmental
    entity or its representatives. Individuals and groups often attempt
    to shape public policy through education, advocacy, or mobilization
    of interest groups. Shaping public policy is obviously different in
    Western-style democracies than in other forms of government, but it
    is reasonable to assume that the process always involves efforts by
    competing interest groups to influence policy makers in their
    favor.

    “Chapter 16: Policymaking and Domestic Policies” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Chapter 16 on pages 679-725. When government
    decides to act, it mostly does so through public policy, which is a
    specific course of action that government takes to address a
    problem, such as the federal budget deficit. A public policy can be
    conveyed to the public in the laws passed by Congress and signed by
    the president, opinions issued by the Supreme Court, and/or rules
    written by the executive branch. But whatever form it takes, a
    public policy tells the public who is about to get what, when, and
    how, from government. Though the authors of the text seem to applaud
    the Obama Administration on economic policy, the discussion and
    concepts discussed in the chapter provide you with the tools and
    constructs to critically evaluate whether you agree with the
    arguments and claims regarding the Obama Administration’s economic
    policies advanced in the text.

**5.2 Economic Policy** <span id="5.2"></span> 
*“Economic policy” refers to the actions that governments take in order
to influence the economy. In recent years, credit, mortgage, and
regulatory policies have contributed to an economic crisis in the United
States. Responding to the economic crisis, the government has become
more involved in managing the economy than ever before. Monetary policy
is mainly determined by the Federal Reserve Board. Fiscal policy is
mainly made by the president’s economic advisors and Congress.*

**5.2.3 Government Actions: Taxing and Spending** <span
id="5.2.3"></span> 
*Tax collecting is one of the oldest activities of government. Today,
the federal government gets most of its funds from payroll taxes (for
Social Security and Medicare), personal and corporate income taxes,
admission fees to federal parks, import taxes, fines, and revenue from
the sale of federal products. Much of the federal government’s revenue
is spent on benefit payments to individuals – Social Security, Medicare,
Medicaid, and other major social programs – and national defense.
However, there are wide philosophical disagreements among elected
officials and the general public on what the government should tax and
pay for, and how much.*

    activity and to ensure equal rights in employment, housing, and the
    like. Reflect back on what you learned in Unit 3 about the

    26 and 27)  
        
     Instructions: Watch these two lectures on foreign and defense
    policy. Foreign policy refers to actions the United States
    government takes on behalf of its national interests abroad to
    ensure the security and wellbeing of Americans and the strength and
    competitiveness of the US economy. A secure group of citizens
    requires protection of recognized national boundaries, a strong
    economy, and a stable, orderly society. The Constitution lays out
    the institutional framework for foreign and defense policy that is
    clearly a federal power, not a power of the states. The Framers
    intended to divide responsibility for foreign affairs between the
    president and Congress.  
        
     Watching these lectures and taking notes should take approximately
    1 hour and 15 minutes.
