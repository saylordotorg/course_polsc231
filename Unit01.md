**Unit 1: American Political Foundations** <span id="1"></span> 
*The American political system is rich in history. In order to gain a
comprehensive understanding of the American government, you will need to
learn this history and recognize the ways in which it impacts the
political landscape today.  
    
 This unit will begin with a brief introduction to the course as well as
a concise overview of the American political system. We will focus on
broad-based questions and explore the defining characteristics of
American government and political culture. Next, we will work to
identify the origins of American republican democracy, learning how it
developed and evolved into our current political system. Finally, we
will conclude by examining the key aspects of the American Constitution
and relate its design and development to the unique American political
culture in place today.*

    and [“The Declaration of
    Independence”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/POLSC2311.2.12.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read both documents. The Declaration of Independence
    is a statement adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776,
    which announced that the 13 American colonies, then at war with
    Great Britain, regarded themselves as independent states, and no
    longer a part of the British Empire. Instead, they formed a new
    nation – the United States of America. The interpretation of the
    Declaration of Independence has been the subject of much scholarly
    analysis. It justified the independence of the United States by
    listing colonial grievances against King George III, and by
    asserting certain natural and legal rights, including a right of
    revolution. Having served its original purpose in announcing
    independence, the text of the Declaration was initially ignored
    after the American Revolution. Since then, it has come to be
    considered a major statement on human rights. In addition, the
    Declaration is, in many ways, a statement of principles through
    which the United States Constitution can be interpreted.  
        
     Reading these documents and taking notes should take approximately
    1 hour.

    Link: The Library of Congress’ [“Articles of
    Confederation”](http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/articles.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read the commentary that accompanies the Articles of
    Confederation as well as the document itself. This site, and the
    supplementary links, especially the *Atlantic Monthly* article on
    the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation, provides important
    historical background for understanding the Articles and the
    development of the US Constitution. Adopted in 1781 during the
    Revolutionary War, the Articles created a loose confederation of 13
    sovereign states with marginal formal central government power. The
    national government under the Articles proved to be very weak and
    the states sought more and more power sometimes in opposition to one
    another. The commentary explains some of the Articles’ most critical
    shortcomings, which eventually prompted the creation of a
    constitutional convention to address the weaknesses. As you read,
    pay particular attention to the treatment of the Bill of Rights
    throughout the early years of American political history.  
        
     Reading this document and commentary should take approximately 30
    minutes.

**1.2.3 The Constitutional Convention of 1787: Debates and Compromises**
<span id="1.2.3"></span>

    Debates and Compromise”**
    Link: The Saylor Foundation’s [“Constitutional Convention: Debates

    Compromise”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/POLSC231-1.2.3-Constitutional-Convention-Debates-and-Compromise-FINAL.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read this short article, which will provide you with
    some background information on the concerns that the Founding
    Fathers had before and during the Constitutional Convention and the
    compromises they were forced to make when creating the US
    Constitution.  
        
     Although the Convention was intended to revise the Articles of
    Confederation, the intention from the outset of many of its
    proponents, chief among them James Madison and Alexander Hamilton,
    was to create a new government rather than fix the existing one. The
    most contentious disputes revolved around congressional
    representation, the nature of executive power, and the abolition of
    the slave trade. Most of the partisan lines among the delegates
    developed between large/small states and northern/southern states.
    After a four-month debate, what resulted was the United States
    Constitution, placing the Convention among the most significant
    events in the history of the United States.  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 1 hour.

    Convention Plans”**

    Plans”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/POLSC231-1.2.3-Assessment-FINAL-Worksheet.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: During the 1787 Constitutional Convention, the most
    contentious disputes revolved around representation in Congress, how
    to structure executive power, and whether the federal judiciary
    should be chosen by the legislature or the executive branch. In
    addition to the overarching issue of slavery, most of the time
    during the convention was spent on deciding these issues.  
        
     The majority of the delegates formed vocal factions to advocate for
    the best interest of their state, and put forth numerous plans that
    reflected their most pressing issues. The two most well-known
    proposals – the Virginia Plan and the New Jersey Plan – helped to
    create the parameters for intense debate and eventual, agreed upon
    compromises.  
        
     For this assessment, you will compare the specific provisions
    outlined in the Virginia Plan, the New Jersey Plan, and the Great
    Compromise. Using this worksheet, write a short description on each
    plan’s proposed structure for the legislative, executive, and
    judicial branches of government. Check your responses using this
    answer key.  
        
     Completing this assessment should take approximately 1 hour and 30
    minutes.

**1.2.4 The Ratification Debate: Federalists vs. Anti-Federalists**
<span id="1.2.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: US Department of State: *About America: The Constitution
    of the United States*: J. W. Peltason’s “Ratifying the Constitution”
    and “The Bill of Rights”**
    Link: US Department of State: *About America: The Constitution of
    the United States*: J. W. Peltason’s [“Ratifying the
    Constitution”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/POLSC2311.2.5.pdf) (PDF)
    and [“The Bill of
    Rights”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/POLSC2311.2.52.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read these short excerpts for some background
    information on the important role that the Bill of Rights played in
    securing ratification of the Constitution. Despite the several
    months spent debating and compromising on key aspects of the
    Constitution, some delegates were still unsatisfied with the final
    document. The ratification process divided many Americans into two
    opposing camps – the Federalists (who supported ratification) and
    the Anti-Federalists (who opposed it). The latter felt the national
    government would be given too much power at the expense of state
    governments and that, more critically, the Constitution provided no
    written guarantee of individual liberties (a “bill of rights”). The
    Federalists thought a listing of rights could be a dangerous thing.
    If the national government were to protect specific listed rights,
    what would stop it from violating rights other than the listed ones?
    Since we can’t list all the rights, the Federalists argued, it was
    better to list none at all. However, the Federalists finally
    relented when it became apparent that New York and Virginia – states

     Instructions: Read “Federalist No. 10” and “No. 51,” two of the
    most famous *Federalist Papers* written by James Madison and among
    the most highly regarded of all American political writings. For No.
    10, identify why he believes that the Constitution provides for a
    form of government that will control “factions” and fulfill the will
    of the people. No. 51 addresses the means by which appropriate
    checks and balances can be created in government, and also advocates
    a separation of powers within the national government. One of its
    most important ideas is the often-quoted phrase, “Ambition must be
    made to counteract ambition.” You can find the remainder of the

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: The Constitution originally consisted of seven
    articles. The first three articles embody the doctrine of the
    separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into
    three distinct branches. The fourth and sixth articles frame the
    doctrine of federalism, describing the relationship between states
    and between the states and the federal government. The fifth article
    provides the procedure for amending the Constitution and the seventh
    article provides the procedure for its ratification. A closer look
    at the wording of the Constitution reveals how its framers
    successfully separated and balanced governmental powers to safeguard
    the interests of majority rule and minority rights.

     Instructions: Watch this public presentation of Supreme Court
    Justices Scalia and Breyer. Their discussion outlines different
    philosophical views of the constitution. Justice Breyer sees the
    Constitution as a living document that should be viewed through the
    lens of contemporary politics and culture. Justice Scalia does not
    agree and is more inclined to view the Constitution less as a living
    document and more in terms of what the framers of the Constitution
    intended for each amendment. He believes it is a mistake to read the
    Constitution with too much consideration of contemporary cultural
    and political ideas and beliefs.

     Instructions: Read this short excerpt on the Constitution’s
    worldwide influence. After the US Constitution was ratified in 1788,
    it soon became a benchmark for self-government and a model for many
    countries’ constitutions thereafter, including Poland, France,
    Spain, Portugal, and many Italian states. Interestingly, the US
    Constitution is the shortest written Constitution of any sovereign
    country in the world. This was, in many ways, an intentional effort
    by the Founding Fathers to provide the latitude necessary for future
    interpretation and amendments.

     Federalism is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, but it
    is one of the key principles that the document embodies,
    particularly in the way it allocates power between the national
    government and the states. Because the states were preexisting
    political entities in 1787, the US Constitution did not need to
    define or explain federalism in any one section. However, it often
    mentions the rights and responsibilities of state governments in
    relation to the federal government. The federal government has
    certain express powers (also called enumerated powers), which are
    powers spelled out in the Constitution, including the right to levy
    taxes, declare war, and regulate interstate and foreign commerce. In
    addition, the Necessary and Proper Clause, in Section 8 of Article
    I, gives the federal government the implied power to pass any law
    “necessary and proper” for the execution of its express powers.
    Other powers – reserved powers – are reserved for the people or the
    states. Federalism has evolved significantly since it was first
    implemented, and it continues to be the subject of intense academic,
    legal, and political debate.

     Instructions: Read this chapter on the federalist system of
    government in the US on pages 84-119. The US Constitution outlines a
    federalist system of government in which the powers of government
    are divided among national, state, and local governments. Each of
    these levels of government has its own power and responsibilities.
    Note that, in theory, state governments cannot make laws that
    conflict with the laws the national government makes.

     Instructions: Read one of the listed *Federalist Papers* by
    Alexander Hamilton, either No. 16 or No. 17, and read James
    Madison’s No. 39. Hamilton’s Nos. 16 and 17 were two of six topics
    in the *Federalist Papers* to directly address the failures of the
    Articles of Confederation. Within this context, Hamilton argues the
    need for a strong national government to unify the country, and
    seeks to address concerns that the proposed Constitution will lead
    to tyranny. No. 39, written by James Madison, strikes a more
    conciliatory tone towards the federal aspects of the government –
    remember, Hamilton only expounds on the national aspects. He
    believes that only a republican form of government can carry forward
    the principles fought for in the Revolution and demonstrates that
    self-government is both possible and practical.

     Instructions: Watch this two-part presentation on the key elements
    of federalism in the American political system. Layer cake
    federalism – also known as “dual” federalism – describes a certain
    form of federalism in which the national government and state
    governments have distinct realms of authority that do not overlap
    and into which the other should not intrude. This form of federalism
    is in direct contrast to “marble cake” or “cooperative” federalism
    (more on this in the next subunit), which is based on a mixing of
    authority and programs among the national, state, and local
    governments.

    burdensome regulations and requirements. In recent years, there has
    been a push to return power to the states (“devolution”), placing
    the burden of a wide range of domestic programs on state governments
    so that they can design programs in a way that suits their own
    residents.

     Instructions: Since the ratification the Constitution, which
    established a union of states under a federal system of governance,
    two questions have generated considerable debate: What is the nature
    of the union? What powers, privileges, duties, and responsibilities
    does the Constitution grant to the national government and reserve
    for the states and for the people? The answers to these questions
    have been debated time and again, having shaped and been shaped by
    the nation’s political, social, and economic history.  
        
     The authors of this selection identify several significant eras and
    events in the evolution of American federalism over a 200+ year
    period and provide a capsule description of each.

    Federalism”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/POLSC231-1.3.3-Assessment-FINAL1.pdf)
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: The US Constitution establishes a government based on
    federalism – the sharing of power between the national and state
    (and local) governments. The federal government’s powers are
    enumerated in the Constitution, while the states are granted certain
    “reserved” powers. Although they are not mentioned in the
    Constitution, there are nearly 90,000 local governments throughout
    the United States. Local governments have a wide variety of powers
    and responsibilities – overseeing hospitals and libraries, police
    and fire protection, water supply, sewage, refuse collection and
    disposal, building construction rules and lighting streets to name
    just a few.  
        
     The two major reasons for having several levels of government are
    scale and power. Each level of government deals with issues that are
    appropriate to its scale, or size. For example, the federal level
    deals with national security and the declaration of war – issues
    that affect all of the people in the nation. The local levels deal
    with the upkeep and repair of streets – an issue that is only
    important to the people who live in that area. Another reason for
    adopting a federal system is that it is designed to distribute, or
    break-up, power and authority. This structural feature of government
    is designed to protect the people against the whims of one
    all-powerful ruler.  
        
     As a result of our federal system, most Americans do not realize
    the prevalence of government in their everyday lives. The below
    story was formulated by the National Conference of State
    Legislators. Read through [this
    story](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/POLSC231-1.3.3-Assessment-FINAL1.pdf)
    and identify the level of government – federal, state, or local –
    that would most likely deal with each of the items that are
    underlined. (Some items may involve more than one level of
    government). Check your responses with this answer key.  
        
     Completing this assessment should take approximately 1 hour.

**1.3.4 Federalism and Electoral Politics** <span id="1.3.4"></span> 
*The political parties stand for different principles with regard to
federalism. Democrats prefer policies to be set by the national
government. They opt for national standards for consistency across
states and localities, often through attaching stringent conditions to
the use of national funds. Republicans usually decry such centralization
and endorse giving powers to the states and reducing funds for the
national government.*
