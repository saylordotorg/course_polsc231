**Unit 3: American Institutions** <span id="3"></span> 
*When many people think of the American government, the institutions
that come to mind most often are Congress, the president, and the
Supreme Court. This unit will focus on these three important pillars of
American government in addition to a fourth and often overlooked facet
of American government: the bureaucracy. Each subunit is dedicated to
one of the major institutions and discuss the significant role that the
particular institution plays in the American political system. As we
learned in previous units, the American system of government relies on a
delicate balance of power among many forces. By the end of this unit,
you will understand the specific roles that each institution plays in
establishing and maintaining that balance of power.*

     Instructions: Watch these three video lectures to gain a general
    understanding of important terms and concepts for future readings
    and assessments. The US Congress is one of the world’s most
    significant democratic institutions. On one hand, Congress can enact
    far-reaching and vital legislation. Members often succeed in pushing
    through projects and funding that benefit their home districts.
    However, it is also one of the most criticized – typically for
    having low ethical standards and for being frustratingly slow to
    act, elitist, beholden to special interest groups, and overly
    partisan. It is no wonder that most Americans have a negative
    perception of Congress. Job disapproval ratings for Congress as a
    whole usually range between 20-30 percent among voters. Most of the
    criticisms of Congress are a reflection of three institutional
    factors:
    [here](http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/pls-101-american-democracy/id416088286)

    -   Congress is an entity that is made up of hundreds of elected
        officials, all representing different constituencies, agendas,
        and interests. As a result, members of Congress often disagree
        about major legislation. Any legislative action requires broad
        agreement both within and across the institution.
    -   Because the framers created a system of shared powers, Congress
        has to work with the executive branch. Remember, the president
        has the power to veto any legislation that Congress enacts
        (although they can override the president's veto), so compromise
        becomes the order of the day. This is a system that the Founding
        Fathers desired, so that no one branch could wield more power
        than the others.
    -   Congress is an incredibly complex institution in terms of rules
        and procedures. Thousands of bills are introduced each session
        in Congress, and these bills must traverse a complex legislative
        process involving committees, floor debates, interest group
        influence, and party power struggles. This complexity not only
        slows the process of enacting legislation, it also provides a
        tremendous built-in advantage for opponents of any bill to block
        it. Supporters of a bill must have success at every step.
        Opponents need to win only once. Of the approximate 8,000 bills
        that are introduced in every 2-year congressional cycle, only 5
        percent become public laws.

    Age](http://www.saylor.org/site/textbooks/American%20Government%20and%20Politics%20in%20the%20Information%20Age.pdf)*:
    “Chapter 12: Congress” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Chapter 12 on pages 462-530. The US Congress is
    one of the world’s most significant democratic institutions. Members
    fight hard on behalf of their states and districts and are free to
    introduce any legislation they wish. This openness also makes
    Congress one of the world’s most frustrating institutions. The
    tension between representation and action has existed from the very
    first Congress in 1789. Because Congress is divided into two houses
    with their own rules, procedures, and electoral bases, members often
    disagree about major legislation, even when the public wants action.
    However, as you’ll discover in this subunit, frustration does have a
    purpose and was even intentionally built into our constitutional
    system.  
        
     Reading this chapter and taking notes should take approximately 1
    hour and 15 minutes.
