This course will serve as an introduction to American government and
politics. We will focus on several major themes in the course’s five
constituent units. In the first unit, “American Political Foundations,”
we will consider the core concepts and theoretical underpinnings of the
American system of government: American political culture, the
Constitution, and federalism. A solid grasp of these concepts will help
you better understand the underlying reasons for the structure of the
American political system. In the second unit, “American Political
Behavior,” we will examine the key components of “politics” in the
American system, including public opinion, the mass media, political
parties, interest groups, campaigns, elections, and electoral
participation. In the third unit, “American Institutions,” we will
analyze the major governing bodies in the United States: Congress, the
presidency and the bureaucracy, and the courts. Unit 4, “Civil Rights
and Civil Liberties in America,” will highlight how American government
shapes and influences the individual freedoms and rights of its
citizenship. In our final unit, “Making Policy in the American Political
System,” we will take a close look at social, economic, and foreign
policy and the ways in which the broad themes of constitutional
principles, political behavior, and governmental institutions have
intersected to shape it. Upon completion of this course, you will have a
strong understanding of the American political system and be well
prepared for the courses you will be required to take should you choose
to pursue the political science major.
