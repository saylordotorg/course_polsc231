**Unit 2: American Political Behavior** <span id="2"></span> 
*The diverse American public is a major component of the American
political system. Politics touches the lives of all Americans – voters,
politicians, the young, the old, and everyone in between. Political
scientists are extremely interested in studying how the public
participates in the American political system. This unit will explore
the various areas of political behavior and their influence on American
politics. We will also discuss some more general subtopics that pertain
to the American public and its role in the political system, including
public opinion, the media, political participation, political parties,
campaigns, elections, and interest groups. To fully understand American
democracy, you must consider how these concepts have changed over time
and how they continue to influence politics in America today.*

     Instructions: The media has come to play a very important role in
    shaping our political system. In particular, broadcast media has
    significantly impacted the landscape of American politics ever since
    the first televised presidential debate between John F. Kennedy and
    Richard Nixon in 1960. In addition to the shape and power of the
    media, Dr. Scott also discusses whether Americans consider the media
    to be a trustworthy source of information. Many people question the
    objectivity of the news media and find much of it to be politically
    biased.

    “Chapter 1: Communication in the Information Age” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read Chapter 1 on pages 8-47. The media, in
    particular the print media, have been called the “fourth estate” and
    the “fourth branch of government.” The news media are a pervasive
    feature of American politics and generally help define our culture.
    New communications technologies have made the media more influential
    throughout American society and serve as a link between politicians,
    government officials, and the public. The fact that political
    information can now be transmitted much more quickly and subjected
    to far more individual control has transformed the political
    information environment. New media formats, such as blogs, podcasts,
    and wikis, blend interpersonal interactions with mass communication.
    This chapter examines and discusses the current and rapidly changing
    political information environment and its impact on political
    behavior, processes, and government.

     Instructions: Read this article to learn more about how new
    technologies have influenced the media and politics in our country.
    In the US, there has been a demonstrable shift from the people who
    produce the news to the people who consume it in the form of
    citizen-journalists and bloggers. As a result, citizens have far
    more choices – a phenomenon that has produced a very different
    political discourse.

     Instructions: Read this report. Ben Scott argues that the 2003
    congressional decision to reverse a Federal Communications
    Commission ruling to deregulate the broadcast industry represented
    an important moment in the cross-section between politics and
    policy. Specifically, the policies and regulations that shape the
    media system became political issues for the American people. The
    author makes a number of significant points as to why this happened:
    grassroots pressure trumping corporate interests, the ability of a
    powerful political minority to up-end the process, and the
    unpopularity of media concentration among the American public.
    Finally, he argues that this transformative conflict will carry over
    into other key media issues for years to come.

     Instructions: This report focuses on two prominent television
    events that placed increased attention on the Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC) and the broadcast indecency statute that it
    enforces – the airing of an expletive by rock singer Bono during the
    2003 Golden Globe Awards, as well as the “wardrobe malfunction” that
    occurred during the 2004 Super Bowl half-time show. It also
    discusses the legal evolution of the FCC’s indecency regulations,
    and provides an overview of how the current regulations have been
    applied. While reading the report, consider the various court
    rulings regarding the First Amendment and broadcast media. What has
    been the general consensus, if any, on the constitutionality of
    banning “indecent” words or actions by the government?

     Instructions: Political cartoons are illustrations containing a
    commentary that usually relates to current events or personalities.
    They typically use visual metaphors, humor, and caricatures to
    address often complicated or controversial political issues.
    Colonial America’s earliest pictorial representations in the press
    were political in nature. In 1754 an illustration by Benjamin
    Franklin, titled [“Join or
    Die”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Benjamin_Franklin_-_Join_or_Die.jpg) appeared
    in his newspaper, *The Pennsylvania Gazette*. Along with his
    editorial about the “disunited state” of the colonies, the picture
    helped to make his point about the importance of colonial unity
    during the French and Indian War.  
        
     Today, political cartoons can be found on the editorial page of
    most newspapers, and they are disseminated widely on the Internet.
    They have been influential in shaping public opinion both
    historically and presently, and they play a critical role in helping
    citizens understand both the positive and negative aspects of
    representative democracy.  
        
     For this assessment you will analyze the techniques, styles, and
    themes of various contemporary political cartoons. Please follow the
    directions in [this

     Instructions: Why do we participate and vote the way we do? What
    are the factors that prevent us from voting? What are the types of
    participation? Conventional methods of participation are voting,
    writing public officials, engaging in public demonstrations, and
    volunteering for campaigns. Unconventional forms of participation
    include militia training, engaging in riots, looting, and blocking
    entrances to public buildings. Over time, we have seen a gradual
    extension of Americans’ right to vote. Early in the republic’s
    history, only white, landowning men could vote, but during Andrew
    Jackson’s presidency, property qualifications fell out of favor. By
    the 1850s, all taxpaying and landholding requirements were lifted
    for white males. It wasn’t until the passage of the 15th Amendment
    to the Constitution that black males were given the right to vote;
    however, many southern states enacted measures to prevent blacks
    from voting – i.e., poll taxes, literacy tests, intimidation – which
    lasted well into the 20th century. The 19th Amendment, passed in
    1920, formally gave women the right to vote in elections. A number
    of civil rights bills and constitutional amendments were passed in
    the 1950s and 1960s to remove some of the remaining vestiges of
    discrimination toward African Americans and other minority groups.

     Instructions: Read Chapter 8 on pages 277-323. There are many
    different ways that Americans can participate in politics, including
    voting, joining political parties, volunteering, contacting public
    officials, contributing money, working in campaigns, holding public
    office, protesting, and rioting. Voting is the most prevalent form
    of political participation, but many eligible voters do not turn out
    in elections. People can also take part in social movements, in
    which large groups of individuals with shared goals work together to
    influence government policies.

     Instructions: Watch this two-part presentation on voting behavior,
    voter turnout, and how they change given certain conditions. The
    demographics of the American population – gender, education,

    as to why/if people will vote. For example, “Baby Boomers,” vested
    with a strong sense of civic duty based on their formative years in
    the 1960s, are very likely to vote. It also looks at the phenomena
    of voter intensity, issue saliency, and political efficacy in
    determining people’s likelihood of voting.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Voter turnout in the United States has risen and
    fallen over time, depending on a complex mixture of social,
    political, and economic forces. According to the Center for Voting
    and Democracy, after rising sharply from 1948 to 1960, turnout
    declined in nearly every election until it dropped to less than half
    of eligible voters in 1988. Since 1988, it has fluctuated, from a
    low of 52.6% of eligible voters in 1996 to a high of 61% of eligible
    voters in 2004, the highest level since 1968. Examining statistics
    about who votes, where, and when, can provide useful insight into
    the challenges (and opportunities) in fostering voter engagement and
    a healthy democracy.  
        
     For [this

     Instructions: Political parties are among some of the oldest
    organizations in the United States. At one point in our country’s
    history, they were very strong and dominant in our political system.
    However, the strength of political parties has declined in recent
    years due to a combination of factors: a rise in the number of
    political action committees (PACs), interest groups, and
    professional campaign consultants, which have effectively “pushed
    out” the role of political parties in deciding how citizens will
    vote. In addition, people’s attachment to political parties has
    significantly waned with the increase in the number of voters who
    consider themselves political “independents.” Dr. Scott also
    discusses the structure of the US two-party system (versus a
    multi-party system) and how it impacts the outcome of elections.

     Instructions: Read this concise historical explanation of political
    parties in the American system of government. Political parties are
    not mentioned in the Constitution – in fact, the Founding Fathers,
    including George Washington, were wary of “factions” that could
    undermine democracy.While Washington accepted the fact that it was
    natural for people to organize and operate within groups like
    political parties, he also argued that every government has
    recognized political parties as an enemy and has sought to repress
    them because of their tendency to seek more power than other groups
    and take revenge on political opponents. Despite his warnings,
    political parties developed soon after the Constitution was written,
    largely out of necessity. Political leaders who also opposed parties
    recognized the need to organize officeholders who shared views so
    that government could operate effectively.

     Instructions: Watch the two-part presentation on the history and
    evolution of political parties in America. The first political
    parties arose in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century and came to be
    defined by the competing philosophies of Alexander Hamilton and
    Thomas Jefferson. Hamilton, a Federalist, felt it was important to
    invest in manufacturing and industry, while Jefferson, a
    Democratic-Republican, sought to protect agrarian interests,
    focusing instead on the power of the individual farmer. The
    Democratic-Republicans sustained prominence in Congress and the
    presidency for more than 20 years after George Washington left
    office, culminating with the demise of the Federalist Party and the
    beginning of the Second Party System.

     Instructions: Watch this two-part presentation on the structure and
    functions of political parties in the US. Political parties serve
    three important functions: helping the electorate to decide,
    contesting elections, and organizing government. Parties in America
    are organized much like the federal government – each has offices at
    the national, state, and local level – and often operate in a
    decentralized manner. The presentation also goes on to describe the
    historical evolution of political parties, beginning with the
    political machines of the late 19<sup>th</sup> century up until the
    early 20<sup>th </sup>century political reforms, such as primary
    elections, that stripped political parties of much of the power they
    held historically. Finally, some of the key ideological differences
    between the Republican and Democratic parties are discussed.

-   **Assessment: The Saylor Foundation’s “Third Parties”**
    Link: The Saylor Foundation’s “Third Parties”  
        
     Instructions: Throughout the history of American politics, no more
    than two political parties have ever dominated at one time. Today,
    the two major political parties in the U.S. are the Democratic Party
    and the Republican Party. These parties have emerged as dominant due
    in large part to their many supporters, and their organizing and
    fundraising capabilities. Third parties, on the other hand, have a
    relatively small base of support and money. More importantly, their
    candidates rarely win elections.  
        
     Third parties are *generally* categorized in three ways:

    -   Ideological – based on ideals that are often radically different
        from those of the two major parties;
    -   Single-Issue – addressing one main concern;
    -   Factional – parties that have split from a major party.

    For this assessment you will conduct research on a third party,
    either current or defunct, and answer the questions below. A list of
    current third parties can be found at
    [Politics1](http://www.politics1.com/parties.htm) or by conducting
    an Internet search for American third parties.  
        
     1. In what category does the third party belong? Why?  
        
     2. What political and/or social factors led to the emergence of
    this party?  
        
     3. List three of the party’s platform issues or political goals.  
        
     4. What has been the impact of the party on electoral politics
    and/or national public policy?  
        
     After you have answered these questions, you may check your work
    against [this guide to
    responding](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/POLSC231-2.4.2-GuideToResponding-FINAL.pdf).  
        
     Completing this assessment should take approximately 1 hour and 30
    minutes.

    Platform”**
    Link: Democratic National Committee: “[2012 Democratic National
    Platform”](http://www.democrats.org/democratic-national-platform) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Scroll down to “Download the PDF” to read the
    platform. Prior to the conventions every four years, the committees
    for the national parties choose key party members who meet to
    contribute, debate, and vote on policy stances that become the basis
    of their party's official platform. Party delegates – citizens
    selected to represent their states at national conventions – vote to
    support or amend platform drafts. Eventually, each position is
    presented as a carefully worded “plank” in a final platform
    document.  
        
     Party platforms are nuanced marketing tools as well as political
    ideologies. As a result, platforms are intended to appeal to the
    largest possible base within the party – a difficult task in a
    membership group representing millions of people – in addition to
    convincing undecided voters. To that end, be sure to “read between
    the lines” to get to the core of what is really being stated in the
    platform. Finally, keep in mind that both parties will often have
    similar goals, such as improving education, but have different
    viewpoints on how they should be achieved. Being aware of this will
    help you to make a clearer distinction between their fundamental
    ideological positions. You will be asked to read the Republican
    Party platform in the resource box below.

     Instructions: Watch the two-part presentation on party
    identification and national shifts in party control (realignment and
    dealignment) in the American political system. A person’s loyalty to
    or preference for one political party is called party
    identification. When people identify with a party, they usually
    agree with the party’s stance on a few major issues and give little
    weight to its stance on issues they consider minor or secondary.
    Additionally, the web media discusses how some elections can serve
    as turning points that define the agenda of politics and the
    alignment of voters within parties during periods of historic change
    in the economy and society.

     Instructions: Watch these three lectures. The nature of campaigns
    and elections has changed dramatically over the past several
    decades. The use of the Internet, professional polling and media
    consultants, electronic mailing lists, and focus groups have, in
    effect, raised the stakes – and the amount of money needed to mount
    a successful campaign. At the same time, candidates find themselves
    relying on more traditional campaign strategies, such as preserving
    their core base of supporters, trying to *run to the middle* to
    convince undecided voters, and focusing on those states that have
    the greatest chance of payoff during the general election. All of
    these factors have resulted in millions of dollars being spent to
    wage a campaign, and success is by no means guaranteed. Dr. Scott
    also discusses some of the costs associated with these campaigns and
    shows that despite the enactment of notable campaign finance
    reforms, campaigns are now raising more money than ever before.

    “Chapter 11: Campaigns and Elections” (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read this chapter on pages 406-462. Elections are
    crucial in a representative democracy like the United States. They
    enable people to choose their leaders and thereby influence public
    policy. They endow elected officials with legitimacy. There are two
    main types of elections: primary elections and general elections.
    Candidates from the same political party compete for the party’s
    nomination in primary elections. Candidates from different parties
    run in the general election, which determines who will take
    office.

     Instructions: Watch this video to learn about the Iowa caucuses and
    how Iowa voters play an important role in nominating candidates for
    president. Historically, the Iowa caucuses have served as an early
    indication of which candidates for president might win the
    nomination of their political party at that party’s national
    convention, and which ones could drop out for lack of support. Think
    about the criticism that the Iowa caucuses play too much of a role
    in the early nominating process. Many believe that because its
    population does not reflect nationwide demographics, the Iowa
    caucuses should not be portrayed as an indicator of the types of
    voters that turn out in the general campaign.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Every four years, the major political parties in the
    United States select their presidential candidates through a process
    of primary elections and caucuses. This nominating process relies on
    a dense matrix of national and state party rules and state election
    laws. The process has gone through several reforms – most notably in
    the early 1970s when new rules made the selection process more open
    and responsive to rank-and-file party voters, and reduced the power
    of party leaders and bosses to control delegations to the national
    conventions. Despite its complicated nature, the presidential
    nominating process is simply a race among presidential candidates to
    accumulate a majority of delegates in order to claim the nomination
    at the national convention.  
        
     [This
    assessment](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/POLSC231-2.5.2-NCCRS-Assessment-FINAL.pdf)

    which you will match the term identified with the presidential
    nominating system with its correct description. The second part
    consists of two short-answer questions. Be sure to review the above
    resources before formulating your answers. After you finish, you can
    check your work against [this answer key and guide to

     Instructions: Watch both presentations to learn about the unique
    structure of congressional and presidential elections in the
    American political system. For one of the lessons, you will learn
    about the power of incumbency when it comes to congressional
    elections. Incumbent office holders have a number of advantages:
    name recognition, a significant re-election war chest, and franking
    privileges. Many challengers can be intimidated by these factors and
    decide not to run. In many ways, the nature of incumbency makes the
    political process more intractable for newcomers. When watching the
    presentation, think about the pros and cons of having incumbents
    hold office for so long. For example, seniority and *institutional
    memory* can help many legislators become effective policymakers for
    their constituents; on the other hand, legislative institutions are
    missing a fresh perspective on the important policy issues of the
    day.

     Instructions: Watch this video, which serves as a helpful primer on
    the role of the Electoral College in electing US presidents. While
    watching the video, think about the consequences of having an
    Electoral College for democracy in America. The fact that the
    popular vote winner in the 2000 presidential election (Al Gore) did
    not become president prompted a national debate on the Electoral
    College. Supporters of eliminating the Electoral College advocate a
    direct popular election of the president, which would give every
    voter the same weight in accordance with the “one-person, one-vote”
    doctrine. Opponents contend that this type of plan would undermine
    federalism and make presidential campaigns more remote from voters,
    as candidates might stress television and give up their forays into
    shopping centers, city malls, and other nontraditional campaign
    forums across the country. The next reading discusses these
    arguments in more detail.

     Instructions: Read this debate on whether the Electoral College
    should continue to play a role in selecting the American president.
    Ross Baker makes the case for retaining the Electoral College as it
    was established by the US Constitution in 1787. Baker is a professor
    of political science at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New
    Jersey. Jamie Raskin presents the arguments for adapting the
    Electoral College system to ensure that election results reflect the
    national popular vote. Raskin is a Maryland state senator and a
    professor of constitutional law at American University in
    Washington, DC. He introduced legislation that made Maryland the
    first state in the country to join the National Popular Vote
    Interstate Compact. Which side – Ross Baker (pro) or Jamie Raskin
    (con) – do you think makes the more convincing argument? Why?

     Instructions: Watch the two-part presentation on the role that
    money plays in campaigns and elections. In the early 1970s, the
    Supreme Court enacted a number of rulings to reduce the influence of
    special-interest groups on federal elections; however, this did not
    prevent the existence of soft money, unlimited amounts of money
    given to political parties for get-out-the-vote activities. In 2002,
    the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act banned soft money and instituted
    limits on the amount of money that federal candidates can receive
    per election cycle. However, a number of loopholes have enabled
    special-interest groups to circumvent the law and operate outside of
    IRS regulations. Needless to say, running a successful campaign
    costs more than ever before. Many political candidates now spend an
    inordinate amount of time raising money for their campaigns.

     Instructions: Watch these two lectures to gain a general
    understanding of important terms and concepts for future readings
    and assessments.  
        
     The framers understood that organized interests would always
    attempt to influence public policy. In fact, after the Constitution
    was written, interest groups formed immediately in support of and
    opposition to its ratification (Federalists vs. Anti-Federalists).
    The Anti-Federalists argued against the new Constitution claiming
    that the United States would be too large to govern as a democracy
    (republic) and had too many groups, or factions (groups of people
    connected by shared beliefs). While James Madison acknowledged that
    there were many differing factions, he also indicated that a
    democratic form of government, using the ideal of majority rule,
    would tame the factions and cause them to work together as much as
    possible. He claimed that the republican form of government created
    by the new Constitution would allow all the factions to express
    themselves and to influence the workings of government by getting
    their members elected and/or appointed to offices. Minority groups
    would be protected because the factions would have to negotiate
    their differences. In this way, the republic would create a system
    of government in which the majority would rule but the ideas of the
    minority would have to be taken into consideration. Numerous
    factions would also mean that no one group would be able to take
    complete control of the government.  
        
     This seems like a logical and well-meaning argument on the merits
    of interest groups; however, elected officials as well as the public
    are often critical of the roles of special-interest groups in the
    political process. The activities of lobbyists (who try to influence
    legislation on behalf of interest groups) can smack of vote buying
    and influence peddling. There are so many organized lobbies today,
    which represent numerous segments of society and address a wide
    range of issues, that the distinction between special-interest
    groups and those of the American people may no longer be valid. In a
    sense, interest groups are the American people.

    “Chapter 9: Interest Groups”  
        
     Instructions: Read Chapter 9 on pages 323-353. Interest groups have
    long been important in electing and defeating candidates, in
    providing information to officeholders, and in setting the agenda of
    American politics. Americans have long been concerned about the
    power of what some call special interests and the tendency of groups
    to pursue self-interest at the expense of less organized groups or
    the general public. As this unit will show, restraining the negative
    tendencies of interest groups while protecting liberty is not an
    easy task.

**2.6.1 History and Role of Interest Groups in American Politics** <span
id="2.6.1"></span> 
*What we call* interest groups *today, the founders of the Republic
called* factions*. For the framers of the Constitution, the daunting
problem was how to establish a stable and orderly constitutional system
that would also respect the liberty of free citizens and prevent the
tyranny of the majority, or of a single dominant interest. Today,
interest groups exist to make demands on government.*

**2.6.2 Types of Interest Groups** <span id="2.6.2"></span> 
*Interest groups vary widely: some are formal associations or
organizations, while others have no formal organization. Some are
organized primarily to lobby for limited goals or to broadly influence
public opinion by publishing reports and mass mailings. Interest groups
can be categorized into several broad types.*

**2.6.3 Lobbying and Other Interest Group Resources and Tools** <span
id="2.6.3"></span> 
*For many decades, interest groups have engaged in lobbying, but these
efforts have become much more significant as groups become more deeply
involved in the electoral process, especially through the expanded use
of political action committees (PACs), mass mailings, advertising
campaigns, and litigation.*

**2.6.4 Evaluating the Impact of Interest Groups: Good or Bad for
Democracy?** <span id="2.6.4"></span> 
*While media coverage on interest groups is more negative than positive,
focusing on the activities of powerful interest groups in finance,
energy, and manufacturing, an oft-quoted statement is that “the special
interest is us,” meaning that we are all beneficiaries of interest-group
activity in the form of consumer protection, cleaner air, safer drinking
water, and workplace safety. It is perhaps more accurate to state that
interest groups are both good and bad for democracy. Do you agree with
this statement? Why or why not?*
