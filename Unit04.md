**Unit 4: Civil Rights & Civil Liberties in America** <span
id="4"></span> 
*An important aspect of American government is the significance of civil
rights and civil liberties granted to Americans. Freedoms and rights
were an inicial factor in shaping the American political system, and
they continue to play a major role in our society today. The
Constitution, especially the Bill of Rights, defines Americans’ rights
and freedoms; however, as society has changed, so too has the perception
and realization of civil liberties and civil rights. In this unit, we
will explore the freedoms and rights of American citizens. We will begin
by looking at the civil liberties guaranteed in the Constitution,
especially in the Bill of Rights. This unit will especially focus on the
rights defined in the First Amendment; the Second Amendment's right to
bear arms; the right to privacy; and how the courts’ interpretation of
these rights have been applied, or incorporated, by the states. Next, we
will explore the evolution of civil rights in the American political
system, with an emphasis on the Civil Rights Movement, and political
equality of all Americans. The unit will also pay close attention to how
the American political system creates a balance between order and
freedom, on one hand, and equality and rights on the other.*

     Instructions: Watch these three lectures to gain a general
    understanding of important terms and concepts. It is important to
    make the distinction between civil liberties and civil (equal)
    rights. The Constitution, especially its Bill of Rights, protects
    many civil liberties. These amendments limit the powers of the
    federal government, protecting the rights of all citizens,
    residents, and visitors on US territory. Among the rights these
    amendments guarantee are the following: the freedoms of speech,
    press, and religion; the freedom to assemble and to petition the
    government; the right to keep and bear arms; and freedom from
    unreasonable searches and seizures, from cruel and unusual
    punishment, and from self-incrimination. Civil rights, on the other
    hand, are the protections against unequal treatment that the
    government guarantees to all groups. The forms of inequality based
    on our nation’s history came in three forms: inequality of
    opportunity, inequality of outcome, and segregation. Numerous
    minority groups spent several decades or even hundreds of years
    fighting for equality under the law.

     Instructions: Read the first ten Amendments to the Constitution,
    commonly known as the Bill of Rights, and the annotations to learn
    about what rights are granted to Americans therein. The individual
    rights and freedoms that government may not infringe upon are
    primarily listed in the Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791 by the
    founders to address fears about the new federal government’s
    potential to abuse power. Initially limited to the federal
    government, they now apply, though unevenly, to the states, as well.
    What these liberties are and how far they extend continues to be the
    focus of political conflict.

     Instructions: Watch these four presentations to learn about some
    components of the First Amendment. The First Amendment, like the
    rest of the Bill of Rights, originally restricted only what the
    federal government may do and did not bind the states. Most state
    constitutions had their own bills of rights, and those generally
    included provisions similar to those found in the First Amendment.
    But the state provisions could be enforced only by state courts. In
    1868, however, the Fourteenth Amendment was added to the US
    Constitution, and it prohibited states from denying people “liberty”
    without “due process.” Since then, the US Supreme Court has
    gradually interpreted this to apply most of the Bill of Rights to
    state governments.

     Instructions: Watch this two-part presentation to learn more about
    privacy rights established under the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth
    Amendment prevents the government from conducting “unreasonable
    searches and seizures.” A reasonable search is conducted with a
    warrant issued by a judge and based on probable cause. What is
    “unreasonable” varies with how much privacy people can expect when
    they are being searched.

     Instructions: Watch this two-part presentation to learn more about
    how many of the rights protected by the Constitution have been
    extended and are now protected by the states. The incorporation of
    the Bill of Rights (or incorporation, for short) is the process by
    which American courts have applied portions of the US Bill of Rights
    to the states. Prior to the 1890s, the Bill of Rights was held only
    to apply to the federal government. Under the incorporation
    doctrine, most provisions of the Bill of Rights now also apply to
    the state and local governments, by virtue of the due process clause
    of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.

     Instructions: Watch this four-part presentation to learn more about
    the due process of the law and how these rights have extended to the
    states. One of the most fundamental tasks for a democratic society
    is to balance the needs of law enforcement versus the fundamental
    rights of its citizens. Many of the rights enumerated in the
    Constitution and the Bill of Rights were designed to ensure that
    people accused of crimes would have a fair opportunity to respond,
    and that the government had to bear the burden of proving guilt
    beyond a reasonable doubt. The founders of our democracy understood
    that they were conferring upon the newly formed government
    tremendous powers to deprive people of their happiness, their
    liberty, and even their lives. But as has often been said, our
    rights were not always self-executing – they required advocates to
    come forward and press for their enforcement.

     Instructions: Read Chapter 5 on pages 156-195. Civil rights protect
    people against discrimination. They focus on equal access to social
    and political activities such as voting. Civil rights are pursued by
    disadvantaged groups that, because of a single characteristic, have
    historically been discriminated against, particularly in the case of
    African Americans and women.

    Amendments”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oMt4XRaeGA) (YouTube)  
        
     Instructions: Watch the first part, Topic 1, of this two-part
    presentation on the Civil War Amendments. The Reconstruction
    Amendments are the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth amendments
    to the United States Constitution, passed between 1865 and 1870, the
    five years immediately following the Civil War. This group of
    Amendments is sometimes referred to as the Civil War Amendments.  
        
     These Amendments were intended to restructure the United States
    from a country that was, in Abraham Lincoln’s words, “half slave and
    half free” to one in which the constitutionally guaranteed
    “blessings of liberty” would be extended to the entire populace,
    including the former slaves and their descendants. The Thirteenth
    Amendment, which was proposed and ratified in 1865, abolished
    slavery. The Fourteenth Amendment, which was proposed in 1866 and
    ratified in 1868, provides a broad definition of national
    citizenship, overturning the Dred Scott case, which excluded African
    Americans from becoming citizens. It required the states to provide
    equal protection under the law to all persons – not just citizens
    – within their jurisdictions. The Fifteenth Amendment, ratified in
    1870, grants voting rights regardless of “race, color, or previous
    condition of servitude.” As history has shown, it took more than a
    century for these amendments to be enforced, especially in the
    South, where many whites intimidated African Americans to keep them
    from fulfilling their full rights of citizenship, including the
    right to vote.

     Instructions: Watch the second part, Topic 2, of this two-part
    presentation on key figures in the Civil Rights Movement. The civil
    rights movement was and is a worldwide political movement for
    equality before the law. In many situations it took the form of
    civil resistance campaigns aimed at achieving change by nonviolent
    forms of resistance. The process was long and tenuous in the United
    States; however, the efforts of these movements did lead to
    improvements in the legal rights of previously oppressed groups of
    people, especially African Americans. There were a multitude of
    civil rights leaders who had different goals in order to achieve
    equality – everything from all-out rebellion to non-violent
    resistance and working within the existing political system. Compare
    and contrast the tactics each of them used to gain attention for the
    movement.

    presidential administrations of the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century,
    presidents had varying attitudes towards the civil rights movements.
    Some saw it as a hindrance – and a distraction – to their greater
    political agendas, while others felt that civil rights was a matter
    in which they needed to take leadership. Read about how these
    presidents grappled with the issue of civil rights. Who do you think
    took the bravest position on it?

     Instructions: Watch the final part, Topic 4, of this four-part
    presentation on affirmative action. By the late 1970s, federal
    affirmative action programs had been under attack in higher
    education. After a decade in practice, the policies have doubled the
    number of black students attending colleges and universities, yet
    some white applicants who were denied admission blamed affirmative
    action. In 1978, the Supreme Court heard a case filed by Allan
    Bakke, a man who had twice been denied admission to medical school
    at the University of California at Davis. He claimed that
    affirmative action policies had kept him out, thus violating his
    rights. The court’s decision was not clear-cut. It ruled that Bakke
    should be admitted to UC Davis, and it stated that affirmative
    action is permissible but not mandatory. For some Americans, the
    case is proof that the cost of remedying years of discrimination and
